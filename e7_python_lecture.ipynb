    "Python is a programming language in common use today. It's gaining popularity in numerical applications as an open-source alternative to, say, MATLAB, as well used for software developers in its own right but it behaves a lot differently than you might expect programming languages to based on. Let's get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Python and Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike MATLAB, you don't necessarily download Python in one neat application. There are a ton of different ways to interact with and code in Python, but the way generally preferred by people using Python for numerical applications (like the kind of stuff we do in MATLAB) is Anaconda (a way to manage Python versions and associated 'libraries' -- we'll discuss this further later) and Jupyter notebooks (the text-and-code editor you're looking at right now).\n",
    "\n",

    "### Note on Python versions\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has two main versions (sort of like MATALB r2017b and r2018a), Python 2.7 and Python 3. Since I started using Python in the last few years I prefer Python 3, but many people you'll run into (like a few of our teaching team) as well as many legacy applications run in Python 2. The differences are minimal, so I won't be getting into them in this lesson.\n",
